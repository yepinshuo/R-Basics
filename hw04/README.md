Running shiny app in in Rstudio
-------------------------------

In this assignment you’ll be working on a data set containing raw scores of ???ctitious students in a hypothetical Stat 133 course. Overall, this HW will give you the opportunity to work on a relatively small data computing and visualization project. By small we don’t mean simple; there’s actually a fair amount of complexity that you will have to deal with.

From the user point of view, the main deliverable will be a shiny app to visualize:

1.  the overall grade distribution,

2.  the distribution and summary statistics of various scores, and

3.  the relationships between pairs of scores.

From the developer point of vew, you will have to write a number of functions that help you process the data, and compute the required statistics. In addition, you will have to write unit tests for the programmed functions, which is an essential part of any programming task.

-   This home work is about writing functions, testing functions, data preparation and shiny app.
-   The shiny web app is shown in this site.
-   The most hard and time consuming part is the shiny app
-   I think the shiny app is pretty challenging because there is not many relations with class.
