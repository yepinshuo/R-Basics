### Ranking Teams

```{r}
teams <- arrange(teams, desc(salary))
# creating a horizontal bar plot
ggplot(data = teams, aes(x = reorder(team, salary), y = salary)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', fill = "dark grey") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(teams$salary), lwd = 2, col = 2) +
  coord_flip()+
  labs(title = "NBA Teams ranked by Total Salary", 
       y = "Total Salary", x = "Team")
```

```{r}
# creating a horizontal bar plot
ggplot(data = teams, aes(x = reorder(team, points), y = points)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', fill = "dark grey") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(teams$points), lwd = 2, col = 2) +
  coord_flip()+
  labs(title = "NBA Teams ranked by Total Points", 
       y = "Total Points", x = "Team")
```

```{r}
# creating a horizontal bar plot using the efficiency
ggplot(data = teams, aes(x = reorder(team, efficiency), y = efficiency)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', fill = "dark grey") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(teams$efficiency), lwd = 2, col = 2) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "NBA Teams ranked by Total Efficiency", 
       y = "Total Efficiency", x = "Team")
```

* The ranking of the salary is somehow related to the efficiency.
* The Cavaliers is rank number one on both the ranking chart, so in these two
comparasions, CLE is the first in the league. And it is obvious that the 
total salary of the team is related to the quality of the players, as well as the 
total team efficiency. 
* And the relationship between the salary and the points is also relavant.

```{r}
# Creating the new data frame of required vectors
teams1 <- select(teams, points3, points2, 
                 free_throws, off_rebounds, def_rebounds, 
                 assists, steals, blocks, turnovers, fouls)
pca <- prcomp(teams1, scale. = TRUE)
names(pca)
```

```{r}
# showing the eigenvalue
eigs <- data.frame(
  eigenvalue = round(pca$sdev^2, 4),
  proportion = round(pca$sdev^2/sum(pca$sdev^2), 4),
  cumprop = round(cumsum(pca$sdev^2 / sum(pca$sdev^2)), 4)
)
eigs
```

```{r}
# Creating the ggtext plot of the pc values of the teams
pcvalue <- data.frame(teams$team, pca$x)
ggplot(data = pcvalue, aes(x = -PC1, y = PC2)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = pcvalue$team)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col = "dark grey")+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, col = "dark grey")+
  labs(x = "PC1")+
  ggtitle("PCA plot (PC1 and PC2)")
```

```{r}
# Creating the index function
pcscale <- function(x) {
  100 * (x - min(x))/(max(x) - min(x))
}

# rewrite the scaled vector
teams <- mutate(teams, PC1 = -pcvalue$PC1, PC2 = pcvalue$PC2)
teams$PC1 <- pcscale(teams$PC1)
teams
```

```{r}
# Creating the ggplot barplot of the pc values
ggplot(teams, aes(x = reorder(team, PC1), y = PC1)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "dark grey") +
  coord_flip()+
  labs(x = "Team", y = "First PC(scaled from 0 to 100)", 
       title = "NBA teams ranked by scaled PC1")
```



* The scaled pc1 is to show the relative relationship between the teams.
* The largest is 100, and the smallest is 0, so the scaled barplot is more clear to show the rank.
* According to this rank, GSW is no.1.

### Reflection:
* It is not the first time that I deal with this file stuctures, and I feel good about it.
* The relative path is quite useful and organized, avoiding lot of mess.
* Writing R script is not as the rmd file, there is no extra informations, and no code chunks to seperate the codes, so it is very important to organized and write good comments.
* The homework is not so hard, but there is some parameters that I am not familiar with, so it took me longer to find how to use the parameters.
* I asked several classmates about the parameters.
* Several hours to complete it.
* The homework is interesting, but finding the parameters is time consuming and not fun.
