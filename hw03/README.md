# HW03 -  Ranking NBA Teams

From the logistical point of view, the purpose of this assignment is twofold. 
On one hand, we want you to keep working with data frames and producing plots but now using the packages "dplyr" and "ggplot2".
On the other hand, we want you to start working with a little bit more complex file structure.
From the analytical point of view, we will focus on ranking tasks.
This will give us an excuse to introduce Principal Components Analysis (PCA), from a narrow yet useful perspective.
One of the deliverables is to calculate a composite index to rank NBA teams.
